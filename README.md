# 🧠 current-rice

This is my **current rice** setup as of the last push.  
It will change **whenever I update my system** or change my rice.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This config is **made for my machine**.
- It works **on my setup** — Arch Linux, Hyprland, Wayland, etc.
- It may **not** work on your system without changes.

If you try to use this and something breaks,  
👉 **open an issue** and I’ll try to help or clarify.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This is a living rice repo.  
I push updates as I change things — don’t expect stability.

If you fork this, you’re doing so at your own risk.  
Again: **open an issue** if something doesn’t work.
